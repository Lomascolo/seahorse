Docker with Keystone installed. On startup configures Keystone using
environment variables:
* ADMIN_TOKEN - admininistration token
* WM_PASSWORD - password for WM
Also, creates all needed roles in WM and creates sample users for
testing purposes.

Build:

$ docker build -t deepsense/keystone .

Example usage:

$ docker run --restart=always -i -e ADMIN_TOKEN=ADMINX -e
WM_PASSWORD=wmpass  -p 35357:35357 -p 5000:5000 -d deepsense/keystone

Keystone uses /var/lib/keystone.db file as a storage. It is possible to
make the storage persistent by linking the file to host's file system
using "-v" flag.

$ docker run --restart=always -v `pwd`/var_lib:/var/lib/keystone -i -e ADMIN_TOKEN=ADMINX
-e WM_PASSWORD=wmpass  -p 35357:35357 -p 5000:5000
-d deepsense/keystone

If Keystone's storage is not persistent tenant ids will be generated
on each start of Keystone. Please notice that tenant ids are stored also
in WM storage and the link between workflows and their
tenants will be broken.
