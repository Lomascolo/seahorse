Docker-compose allows to run Seahorse and locally using Docker. Because local Seahorse uses Intel's
YARN cluster it is necessary to set up two tunnels using ssh.

$ ./start_dockers.sh

The script will set up tunnels using random ports. Then, generate docker-compose.yml from a template
using the chosen ports. Finally, it will run docker-compose up. When docker-compose end, then the
script will kill the tunnels that were set up previously.

Seahorse will start at http://localhost:8080
