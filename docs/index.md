The primary focus of Seahorse is to enable
<a target="_blank" href="http://spark.apache.org">Apache Spark</a>
users to easily construct complex applications and execute them in a Spark cluster.
Seahorse introduces [Deeplang](deeplang.html) - a visual programming language that lets users create
advanced data processing and machine learning workflows.

Project Seahorse consists of two components:
[Seahorse Editor]({{site.SEAHORSE_EDITOR_ADDRESS}}) and [Workflow Executor](workflowexecutor.html).

### Seahorse Editor

[Seahorse Editor]({{site.SEAHORSE_EDITOR_ADDRESS}}) is a web-based application
that allows user to build [Deeplang workflows](deeplang.html#workflows).

### Workflow Executor

[Workflow Executor](workflowexecutor.html) is an Apache Spark application
that allows user to execute [Deeplang workflows](deeplang.html#workflows).
